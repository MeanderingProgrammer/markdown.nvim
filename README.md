# markdown.nvim

Plugin to improve viewing Markdown files in Neovim

![Demo](demo/demo.gif)

# Features

- Functions entirely inside of Neovim with no external windows
- Changes between `rendered` view in normal mode and `raw` view in all other modes
- Changes `conceallevel` between `rendered` and `raw` view based on configuration
- Supports rendering `markdown` injected into other file types
- Highlights headings with different groups depending on level and replaces `#`
- Updates horizontal breaks with full-width lines
- Highlights code blocks and inline code to better stand out
- Replaces bullet points with provided character based on level
- Replaces checkboxes with provided characters based on whether they are checked
- Replaces block quote leading `>` with provided character
- Updates table borders with better border characters, does NOT automatically align
- Basic support for `LaTeX` if `pylatexenc` is installed on system

# Dependencies

- [markdown & markdown_inline](https://github.com/tree-sitter-grammars/tree-sitter-markdown)
  parsers for [treesitter](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter):
  Used to parse `markdown` files
- [pylatexenc](https://pypi.org/project/pylatexenc/): Used to transform `LaTeX` strings
  to appropriate unicode using `latex2text`, not a mandatory dependency

# Install

## Lazy.nvim

```lua
{
    'MeanderingProgrammer/markdown.nvim',
    name = 'render-markdown', -- Only needed if you have another plugin named markdown.nvim
    dependencies = { 'nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter' },
    config = function()
        require('render-markdown').setup({})
    end,
}
```

# Setup

Below is the configuration that gets used by default, any part of it can be modified
by the user.

# Commands

`:RenderMarkdownToggle` - Switch between enabling & disabling this plugin

- Function can also be accessed directly through `require('render-markdown').toggle()`

# Purpose

There are many existing markdown rendering plugins in the Neovim ecosystem. However,
most of these rely on syncing a separate browser window with the buffer. This is
the correct way to do things to get full feature support, however I wanted something
that worked completely inside of Neovim and made things look slightly "nicer".

The closest one I found to this was [headlines.nvim](https://github.com/lukas-reineke/headlines.nvim),
which is an awesome plugin that I took several ideas from. However it just didn't
have quite what I was looking for. In particular I wanted something that would
disappear completely when editing a file and quickly render some style when viewing
the file. Hence this plugin.

# Markdown Ecosystem

There are many `markdown` plugins that specialize in different aspects of interacting
with `markdown` files. This plugin specializes in rendering the buffer inside of
Neovim, for instance. As a result some plugins will clash with this one, whereas
other plugins handle orthogonal concerns and can be used in addition to this one.
Below is a categorized (incomplete) list of available plugins.

## Render in Neovim

Using any of these plugins with this one will likely lead to undesired behavior as
different functionality will clash.

- [headlines.nvim](https://github.com/lukas-reineke/headlines.nvim) - Same high
  level idea and starting point of this plugin, but with different feature sets

## Render in Browser

These can be used as a second pass to get a real preview of the `markdown` file.
Since they do not interact with the buffer directly there should be no issues.

- [markdown-preview.nvim](https://github.com/iamcco/markdown-preview.nvim)
- [vim-markdown-composer](https://github.com/euclio/vim-markdown-composer)

## Orthogonal

These plugins handle functions completely separate from rendering and should also
have no issues running alongside this plugin.

- Any LSP which provides standard LSP capabilities, such as:
  - [marksman](https://github.com/artempyanykh/marksman) - General completion,
    definition, and reference functionality
  - [markdown-oxide](https://github.com/Feel-ix-343/markdown-oxide) - Adds Obsidian
    PKM features to LSP
- [markdown.nvim](https://github.com/tadmccorkle/markdown.nvim) - Adds `markdown`
  specific keybindings for interacting with `markdown` files
